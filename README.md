This website showcases handcrafted plaster belly wraps created during the final weeks of pregnancy and used in meaningful post-birth photo sessions.

## About the Service

A plaster belly wrap is a custom keepsake that gently captures the natural shape of a mother’s pregnant belly near the end of pregnancy. Each wrap preserves a powerful moment just before birth.

After the baby is born, the wrap is incorporated into a photo session with mother and child. This creates a visual connection between pregnancy and new life, honoring the journey into motherhood and the bond formed before birth.
